## The Review Process

### 😕 Why important?

1️⃣ Whether you end up reviewing a lot of papers as a Ph.D. student, your research will definitely be subject to the paper review process.

2️⃣ It is imperative as a researcher to understand this process.

3️⃣ Knowing the process can help you better write your paper for an audience of reviewers (and a program committee), and it can also help you maintain perspective when your paper is accepted or rejected.

### 😄 Reviewing vs. Reading

**Reading**:

When reading a paper for your own enrichment, your goal is to gather information as quickly as possible.  In this case, you are a *scientist* who seeks to understand the context and content of existing work, to (for example) better understand how your own research might fit into the bigger picture or learn about techniques that might apply to your own work.

**Reviewing**:

A reviewer’s goal is to first and foremost determine the suitability of a paper for some conference and second, to provide feedback to the authors to help them improve the paper in subsequent revisions.

## Does the Paper Realize a Greate Idea?

### 🔍 Look for a reason to accept the paper

Every paper is imperfect.

- The paper may have made an incorrect or imperfect assumption.
- The experiments may not have been as thorough as you liked.
- The graphs may be difficult to read.
- Parts of the paper may be difficult to understand.

These types of issues certainly reflect problems with a paper, but they do not necessarily constitute a reason to reject a paper if they do not affect the correctness or significance of the main underlying conclusion or contribution of the paper.

Therefore, the first two questions I ask myself when reviewing a paper are:

1️⃣ Does the paper have a great idea?

2️⃣ Does it *realize* the great idea?

### 🍪 **What makes an idea "great"?**

Judging a paper’s contribution turns out to be highly subjective, which is why the review process remains so uncertain.

Due to the subjective nature of this judgment, it is all the more important that [your writing is clear](https://greatresearch.org/2013/10/11/storytelling-101-writing-tips-for-academics/ "Storytelling 101: Writing Tips for Academics"), and well-matched to what a reviewer is looking for (i.e., the contributions and ideas).

### 🌀 Invariant Questions

Regardless, there are some invariant questions that most reviewers would (or at least should) always consider, including:

1️⃣ **Is the problem important?**

Seek to summarize the paper’s contribution in one sentence.  Make this short summary the beginning of your review, as well.

Try to convince yourself (by reading the paper or otherwise) that a solution to the problem that the paper is proposing would advance knowledge or significantly improve the state of affairs for some group of people.

Note that *you* may not care about the problem, but also ask yourself whether you can imagine *some* group of readers who will be interested in the solution to the problem.

2️⃣ ***To what extent does the paper solve the problem it describes?***

A single paper very rarely closes the book on a single problem, but it may take an important step towards solving the problem.

It might solve the problem for an important set of operating conditions or under a new set of assumptions.

Or, if the problem area is completely new, perhaps the paper doesn’t really solve the problem at all, but simply articulating a new problem area for follow-on work is a significant contribution.

3️⃣ ***What is the “intellectual nugget”?***

As a reviewer, I try to identify whether a paper has a particular intellectual kernel that lies at the heart of the solution.  This kernel is often what separates an important research contribution from a simple matter of engineering.

This intellectual nugget might be the application (or invention) of a particular technique, a proof of correctness (where one previously did not exist), or an attempt to put the solution into a broader intellectual context.  In other words, the intellectual contribution might be to take a general problem and tackle a specific sub-problem (e.g., under certain assumptions or conditions), or to take a specific problem and generalize it (e.g., develop a general theory, proof of correctness, or taxonomy).

4️⃣ ***What is the main contribution or conclusion?  Is it important?***

As a reviewer, I try to concisely articulate the paper’s main contribution (or small number of contributions).

**Often, a paper will helpfully summarize those contributions somewhere in the introduction (Jim Kurose’s advice on writing paper introductions advises the writer to explicitly do so).**

The reviewer’s job is then to assess whether those contributions are significant or important enough to warrant a publication.

5️⃣ ***Does the content support the conclusion?***

An introduction may make broad (or wild) claims, and it is important to dig into the paper to determine whether the content of the paper supports the conclusion.

**😆 Are the experiments run correctly?:**

**😆 Are they based on the correct set of assumptions?**

😆 **If the conclusion involves comparison to previous work, is the comparison performed in a controlled manner, using an equivalent (or at least fair) experimental setup?**

😆 **If applicable, have the authors released their code and data so that you (or others) can check the claims yourself?**

## Preparing Your Review

### **😮 Consider the audience**

Not every publication venue is the same.

The question of audience involves that of both the “bar” for acceptance (Does the paper meet the audience’s standards for something that is worth reading?) and the “scope” of the venue (is the paper on-topic for the venue?).

Often, scope can be (and is) broadly construed, so the key question really boils down to whether the likely audience for the paper will benefit from reading it.

### ☺️ **Consider the standards**

Your standards will (and should) vary depending on the venue for which you are reviewing a paper submission.

**Workshops are typically more permissive as far as accepting "vision" papers that outline a new problem or problem area or papers that "foster discussion" than conferences, which typically aim to accept more complete pieces of work.**

A good way to get a sense for the standards of a conference for which you are reviewing is to ***read through the complete set of papers that you have been asked to review*** and rank them, before writing a single review.

Reading past proceedings of the particular journal or conference can also help you determine the appropriate standard to set for acceptance.

### 😉 **Consider the purpose**

Different papers serve different purposes.  Multiple paper submissions to the same venue might in fact have quite different purposes, and it is important to establish what the paper is contributing (or attempting to contribute) before passing judgement.

For example, a paper might be a complete piece of work, but it might also be a survey, a tutorial, or simply a proposal.  If the paper is one of the latter types, your first questions as a reviewer should concern whether the audience would benefit from the survey, tutorial, or proposal, and whether such a paper meets the standards for the conference.

**⭐️ Survey**  If the paper is a survey, your assessment should be based on the completeness of the survey, with respect to the area that the paper is claiming to summarize.

**🌔 Tutorial** If the paper is a tutorial, is the description correct and clearly described?

**☀️ Proposal** If the paper is a [proposal](https://greatresearch.org/2013/09/06/you-and-your-research-proposal/ "You and Your Research Proposal"), does the proposed research agenda make sense, and is the outcome (if the proposal is successful) worthwhile?

### 😃 **Consider the big picture**

Every paper can be rejected.  It is always easy to find reasons to reject a paper.  The reviewer’s goal should not be to identify the reasons to reject a paper, but rather to determine *whether there are any reasons to accept the paper.*

You should be aiming to figure out whether the paper has important contributions that the audience will benefit from knowing about, and whether the paper supports those contributions and conclusions to the level of standard that is commensurate with the standard of the audience and the venue.

One litmus test I use to ensure that a negative aspect of a paper does not condemn it is to ask myself whether the problem 1️⃣ affects the main conclusion or contribution of the paper; and 2️⃣ can be fixed easily in a revision.

*If the problem doesn't affect the main contribution or conclusion, and if it can be easily fixed, then it should not negatively affect a paper’s review.*

## Writing Your Review

### **📖 Start with a summary of the paper and its contributions.**

1️⃣ A short, one-paragraph summary describing the paper's main contribution(s) demonstrates to the authors (and to you!) that you understand the main point of the paper.

> This helps you as a reviewer articulate the main contributions and conclusions of the paper for the purposes of your own evaluation

2️⃣ Try to address the type of paper it is (is it a survey paper, for example?), the context for the paper (i.e., how it builds on or relates to previous work), its overall correctness, and its contributions.

> If you cannot concisely summarize the paper, then the paper is not in good shape, and you can reflect this assessment in the review, as well.

3️⃣ These summaries are very helpful to authors, since they may not match the authors’ views of the main contribution!

> For example, as an author, you can easily figure out if you’ve “missed the mark” or whether the reviewer fundamentally misunderstood the paper by reading a reviewer’s summary of your own work.  If the summary of the contribution does not match your own view of the paper’s contribution, then you know that you have some work to do in writing and presentation.

### **🔍 Assess whether the paper delivers on the main claims and contributions**

❗️  You should provide an assessment, for each of the paper's main claims and contributions, whether it delivers on that claim.

> If the main contribution of the paper is flawed, you should indicate whether you think a flaw is “fatal”, or whether the authors could simply fix the flaw in a revision if the paper is accepted.

If the conclusions from the experiments can be restated and still turn out to be meaningful contributions—or, if the flaw in an experiment doesn’t affect the main contribution or conclusion—then even a flaw in experiments can likely be fixed in revision.

💥 Regardless, if there are correctness issues that affect the main contribution of the paper that call into question whether the main result or contribution is correct in the first place, the paper’s review should reflect these concerns and likely cannot be accepted.

### 👍 **Discuss positive aspects of the paper**

**Always try to find something positive, even in "bad" papers.**

Even for particularly bad papers, there might be one sentence in the introduction, discussion, or future work section that makes an interesting point or highlights a possibility for interesting contributions.

In a pinch, if you can't find anything positive, those are good places to look. As a reviewer, you can remark that those observations are interesting, and that you would really like to see those parts of the work further developed.

These positive comments aren't just for author morale (although that's important, too): They give the author a direction to move forward.

👎 The worst reviews are those that reject a paper but don't provide any specific action for moving forward.

👍 The best reviews are those that highlight the positive aspects of the work, while identifying weaknesses and areas where the work could be further developed to address weaknesses or build on the paper's existing strengths.

### 😄 **Criticize the paper, not the authors**

When writing your review, consider the type of review that you would like to receive.  Always be polite, respectful, and positive.  Don't be personal.  Choose your language carefully, as it will help convey your message

For example, if you say "he authors don't consider the related work", that is a much more personal statement than "the paper doesn't consider the related work".

Never, ever insult the authors; don't accuse the authors of being sloppy or unethical researchers.  As a reviewer, you don't always know the full context, so limit your judgement to what you can directly conclude by reading the paper.

### 😮 the type of feedback you would like to receive

Receiving reviews for rejected papers is a part of the research process, but it is never fun for the authors (particularly new Ph.D. students).

Do your part to contribute positively to the process by suggesting changes that you'd like to see if you had to review the paper again.  In all likelihood, you may see the paper again in the form of a revision!
